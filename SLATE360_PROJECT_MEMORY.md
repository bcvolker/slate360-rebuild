"# Slate360 — Project Memory

Last Updated: 2026-04-12
Repo: bcvolker/slate360-rebuild
Branch: main
Live: https://www.slate360.ai

This file is the default new-chat attachment. Keep it short. Read this first, then only pull the docs required for the task.

## AI Agent Access

**AI Agents (Copilot, Claude, etc.) have read/write/run/push access to:**
- **Git**: commit, branch, merge, and push to `bcvolker/slate360-rebuild` on GitHub
- **Vercel**: deploy + env var management via `VERCEL_TOKEN` Codespace secret
- **AWS S3**: bucket `slate360-storage` (us-east-2) via stored credentials
- **Stripe**: webhook and billing management via Vercel env secrets
- **Supabase CLI**: migrations, RPC functions, schema changes to project `hadnfcenpcfaeclczsmm`

This access is intentional. Agents are expected to push commits, run migrations, and deploy — not just suggest changes.

## Start Here

Recommended read order:
1. This file
2. `SLATE360_MASTER_BUILD_PLAN.md` (single source of truth for product direction)
3. Only task-relevant docs from the read map below

Do not read all context files by default.

## Project Snapshot

Slate360 is a Next.js 15 + React 19 + TypeScript SaaS platform with:
- Supabase for auth and primary data
- AWS S3 for file storage
- Stripe for billing
- Vercel for hosting and cron
- Market Robot as an internal route at `/market`

Primary live modules:
- `/dashboard`
- `/project-hub`
- `/slatedrop`
- `/market`

Tier note:
- OLD tiers (`trial < creator < model < business < enterprise`) are OBSOLETE — removed in commit `b5d6224`
- NEW tiers: `trial < standard < business < enterprise` (per-app, not platform-wide)
- Backward-compat: legacy DB rows with "creator" or "model" auto-map to "standard"
- Users subscribe per-app with optional bundle discounts
- Enterprise gets ALL apps + admin + white-label
- `lib/entitlements.ts` rewritten to 4-tier model (standard: $149/mo, 5K credits, 25GB, 3 seats)
- subscription gates use `getEntitlements()`
- trial tier unlocks ALL tabs with tight limits (500 credits, 5GB, 1 seat) + TrialBanner
- `/ceo`, `/market`, and `/athlete360` are internal access routes, not subscription features

## Critical Rules

1. No production `.ts` / `.tsx` / `.js` file over 300 lines.
2. No `any`.
3. Use shared auth wrappers and response helpers.
4. Types come from `lib/types/`.
5. Server components first.
6. Internal routes (`/ceo`, `/market`, `/athlete360`) do not use entitlements.
7. Subscription gates must use `getEntitlements()`.
8. New folder writes use `project_folders`.
9. No mock data in production UI.
10. Update context docs after code changes.

## Backend Quick Access

### Supabase
- URL: `https://hadnfcenpcfaeclczsmm.supabase.co`
- Dashboard: `https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/hadnfcenpcfaeclczsmm`
- Local secrets: `.env.local`
- Clients:

```typescript
import { createClient } from "@/lib/supabase/client";
import { createServerSupabaseClient } from "@/lib/supabase/server";
import { createAdminClient } from "@/lib/supabase/admin";
```

### AWS S3
- Bucket: `slate360-storage`
- Region: `us-east-2`
- Client: `lib/s3.ts`

### Vercel
- Auto-deploy from `main`
- Cron source: `vercel.json`

### Git
- Default branch: `main`
- Standard flow: local edit -> typecheck / verify -> commit -> push
- Do not assume unrelated dirty changes are yours

## Core Commands

```bash
npm run dev
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm run diag:market-runtime
npm run verify:release
bash scripts/check-file-size.sh
```

During build/release work, also run the relevant guards before pushing shared or backend changes.

## Market Robot Focus

Route and gate:
- Route: `/market`
- Gate: `resolveServerOrgContext().canAccessMarket`

Current reality (2026-03-20):
- Tab routing works (6 tabs), 0 TS errors, deploys cleanly
- **Data wiring is completely disconnected** — orchestrator passes dummy data to all tabs
- Backend is production-grade: 8 real hooks, 17 API routes, 25 lib utilities, typed contracts
- V2 rebuild approved — wire orchestrator to hooks first, then rebuild tabs one at a time
- See `MARKET_ROBOT_STATUS_HANDOFF.md` for full critique, V2 plan, and prompt templates

Most important Market files:
- `app/market/page.tsx` — route entry (server component, auth gate)
- `components/dashboard/market/MarketClient.tsx` — orchestrator (needs rewiring)
- `components/dashboard/market/` — all tab components
- `lib/hooks/useMarket*` — 8 working hooks (the entire data layer)
- `lib/market/` — 25 utility files (contracts, mappers, bot engine, scheduler)
- `app/api/market/` — 17 API routes

Files to delete:
- `components/dashboard/MarketClient.tsx` (old, orphaned, 75 lines)
- `components/dashboard/market/MarketRobotWorkspace.tsx` (unused, 84 lines)
- `MARKET_ROBOT_STATUS_HANDOFF.md.bak` (backup of old handoff)

## Archive And Token Policy

Most planning docs have been deleted (2026-04-11 cleanup). Only reference-only files remaining:
- `slate360-context/dashboard-tabs/market-robot/CURRENT_STATE_HANDOFF.md`
- `slate360-context/dashboard-tabs/market-robot/ONGOING_BUILD_TRACKER.md`
- `slate360-context/SUPABASE_EMAIL_TEMPLATES.md`

Use those files only for deep history or recovery work.

## Latest Session Handoff

<!-- Each chat MUST overwrite this section at end of conversation. Next chat reads this first. -->

### Session Handoff — 2026-04-13 (Security Hardening + Entitlements Foundation)

### What Changed (commit 8f9c3e9)

**P0 Security Fixes**
- `lib/entitlements.ts`: Trial TIER_MAP — set canAccessDesignStudio, canAccessContent, canAccessTourBuilder, canAccessGeospatial, canAccessVirtual, canAccessAnalytics, canAccessReports to `false`
- `app/(apps)/design-studio/page.tsx`: gate changed from `canAccessDesignStudio` → `canAccessStandaloneDesignStudio`
- `app/(apps)/content-studio/page.tsx`: gate changed from `canAccessContent` → `canAccessStandaloneContentStudio`
- All 31 Site Walk API routes (49 handlers): `withAuth()` → `withAppAuth("punchwalk")`
- `components/shared/QuickNav.tsx`: all app gate fields now use `canAccessStandalone*` keys
- `components/shared/MobileModuleBar.tsx`: same standalone gate fix

**Entitlements Threading**
- `DashboardSidebar.tsx`: accepts `entitlements` prop, filters APP_LINKS by `canAccessStandalone*`
- `walled-garden-dashboard.tsx`: accepts + forwards `entitlements` prop
- `app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx`: uses `resolveOrgEntitlements(orgId)` (loads tier + feature flags + modular subs)

**Extraction & Cleanup**
- `ProjectFileExplorer.tsx`: 363 → 178 lines (hook → `useProjectFileExplorer.ts` at 236 lines)
- Deleted `app/site-walk/_page.tsx.bak`
- Removed duplicate `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` from `.env` (kept correct `whsec_` value on line 58)

### What's Broken / Partially Done
- **P1: 9 Project Hub monolith files** exceed 300-line limit (931, 599, 579, 465, 448, 421, 403, 358, 339)
- **P1: standard tier TIER_MAP** still grants canAccessDesignStudio/Content/TourBuilder = true — works for now (standard includes those apps) but needs alignment with per-app subscription model when tier policy is finalized
- **P1: Standalone entitlement OR logic** in `getEntitlements()` — `canAccessStandaloneDesignStudio: base.canAccessDesignStudio || flags?.standalone_design_studio` means paid tiers bypass per-app subscription. Acceptable until tier policy is finalized.
- **P2: 14 files over 300 lines** per file-size checker (pre-existing monoliths, no regressions)

### Context Files Updated
- `SLATE360_PROJECT_MEMORY.md`: this handoff

### Next Steps (ordered by priority)
1. Design Slate360 app layout (tier-gating UX, what activates on subscription)
2. Design Site Walk app layout + features
3. Extract Project Hub monoliths (9 files, batch of 3 then batch of 6)
4. Finalize tier policy: what exactly does trial/standard/business/enterprise include?
5. Align `TIER_MAP` + standalone OR logic with finalized tier policy
6. Stripe product/price audit (cross-reference env vars with Stripe dashboard)
7. E2E checkout flow test for Site Walk
8. Rename `basic` → `standard` in modular entitlements
9. Address remaining file-size violations (14 files)
