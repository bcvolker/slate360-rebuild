# Slate360 — Project Memory

Last Updated: 2026-03-31
Repo: bcvolker/slate360-rebuild
Branch: main
Live: https://www.slate360.ai

This file is the default new-chat attachment. Keep it short. Read this first, then only pull the docs required for the task.

## Start Here

Recommended read order:
1. This file
2. `slate360-context/NEW_CHAT_HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md`
3. Only task-relevant docs

Do not read all context files by default.

## Project Snapshot

Slate360 is a Next.js 15 + React 19 + TypeScript SaaS platform with:
- Supabase for auth and primary data
- AWS S3 for file storage
- Stripe for billing
- Vercel for hosting and cron
- Market Robot as an internal route at `/market`

Primary live modules:
- `/dashboard`
- `/project-hub`
- `/slatedrop`
- `/market`

Tier note:
- subscription tiers are `trial < creator < model < business < enterprise`
- subscription gates use `getEntitlements()`
- trial tier unlocks ALL tabs with tight limits (500 credits, 5GB, 1 seat) + TrialBanner
- `/ceo`, `/market`, and `/athlete360` are internal access routes, not subscription features

## Critical Rules

1. No production `.ts` / `.tsx` / `.js` file over 300 lines.
2. No `any`.
3. Use shared auth wrappers and response helpers.
4. Types come from `lib/types/`.
5. Server components first.
6. Internal routes (`/ceo`, `/market`, `/athlete360`) do not use entitlements.
7. Subscription gates must use `getEntitlements()`.
8. New folder writes use `project_folders`.
9. No mock data in production UI.
10. Update context docs after code changes.

## Backend Quick Access

### Supabase
- URL: `https://hadnfcenpcfaeclczsmm.supabase.co`
- Dashboard: `https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/hadnfcenpcfaeclczsmm`
- Local secrets: `.env.local`
- Clients:

```typescript
import { createClient } from "@/lib/supabase/client";
import { createServerSupabaseClient } from "@/lib/supabase/server";
import { createAdminClient } from "@/lib/supabase/admin";
```

### AWS S3
- Bucket: `slate360-storage`
- Region: `us-east-2`
- Client: `lib/s3.ts`

### Vercel
- Auto-deploy from `main`
- Cron source: `vercel.json`
- Stripe secrets live in Vercel envs
- CLI access via `VERCEL_TOKEN` Codespace secret (linked to `slate360/slate360-rebuild`)
- Env var dashboard: `https://vercel.com/slate360/slate360-rebuild/settings/environment-variables`

### Git
- Default branch: `main`
- Standard flow: local edit -> typecheck / verify -> commit -> push
- Do not assume unrelated dirty changes are yours

## Core Commands

```bash
npm run dev
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm run diag:market-runtime
npm run verify:release
bash scripts/check-file-size.sh
```

During build/release work, also run the relevant guards before pushing shared or backend changes.

## Market Robot Focus

Route and gate:
- Route: `/market`
- Gate: `resolveServerOrgContext().canAccessMarket`

Current reality (2026-03-20):
- Tab routing works (6 tabs), 0 TS errors, deploys cleanly
- **Data wiring is completely disconnected** — orchestrator passes dummy data to all tabs
- Backend is production-grade: 8 real hooks, 17 API routes, 25 lib utilities, typed contracts
- V2 rebuild approved — wire orchestrator to hooks first, then rebuild tabs one at a time
- See `MARKET_ROBOT_STATUS_HANDOFF.md` for full critique, V2 plan, and prompt templates

Most important Market files:
- `app/market/page.tsx` — route entry (server component, auth gate)
- `components/dashboard/market/MarketClient.tsx` — orchestrator (needs rewiring)
- `components/dashboard/market/` — all tab components
- `lib/hooks/useMarket*` — 8 working hooks (the entire data layer)
- `lib/market/` — 25 utility files (contracts, mappers, bot engine, scheduler)
- `app/api/market/` — 17 API routes

Files to delete:
- `components/dashboard/MarketClient.tsx` (old, orphaned, 75 lines)
- `components/dashboard/market/MarketRobotWorkspace.tsx` (unused, 84 lines)
- `MARKET_ROBOT_STATUS_HANDOFF.md.bak` (backup of old handoff)

## Archive And Token Policy

Do not pull large history docs unless the task needs them. Default reference-only files:
- `slate360-context/dashboard-tabs/market-robot/CURRENT_STATE_HANDOFF.md`
- `slate360-context/dashboard-tabs/market-robot/ONGOING_BUILD_TRACKER.md`
- `slate360-context/FUTURE_FEATURES.md`
- `slate360-context/APP_ECOSYSTEM_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`
- `slate360-context/SUPABASE_EMAIL_TEMPLATES.md`

Use those files only for deep history, roadmap, or recovery work.

When editing oversized files, always read both the state declarations AND the JSX sections.

## Latest Session Handoff

<!-- Each chat MUST overwrite this section at end of conversation. Next chat reads this first. -->

### Session Handoff — 2026-04-06 (Structural Fixes before UI Phase)

### What Changed

**1. Resolved `/share/[token]` route collision**
- Moved `app/(public)/share/[token]/page.tsx` → `app/(public)/portal/[token]/page.tsx`.
- Public deliverable viewer now lives at `/portal/[token]`, no conflict with SlateDrop's `/share/[token]`.
- Updated doc comment in the file to reflect new path.

**2. Renamed `punchwalk_*` DB columns to `site_walk_*`**
- `supabase/migrations/20260408000008_rename_punchwalk_to_site_walk.sql`:
  - `punchwalk_seat_limit` → `site_walk_seat_limit`
  - `punchwalk_seats_used` → `site_walk_seats_used`
  - Rebuilt `trg_enqueue_deliverable_cleanup()` to reference new column names.
  - Rebuilt `increment_app_seat()` to support both `tour_builder` and `site_walk` app IDs (previously only `tour_builder` was handled). Uses dynamic column resolution.
  - **Applied to live Supabase** — columns verified renamed.
- Note: `standalone_punchwalk` boolean column is NOT renamed (separate concern, still used in TS code).

**3. Playwright configuration + auth test placeholder**
- Added `desktop-chromium` project to `playwright.config.ts` (1280×720).
- Created `e2e/auth.spec.ts` with 4 smoke tests: login page renders, signup page renders, unauthenticated redirect from dashboard, forgot-password page renders.
- Existing `mobile-chromium` project and `e2e/` test directory remain unchanged.

### What's Broken / Partially Done
- JWT hook must be **manually enabled** in Supabase Dashboard → Auth → Hooks.
- `deliverable_cleanup_queue` has no worker yet — queue rows accumulate.
- `(public)/portal/[token]` has no type-specific viewers (TourViewer, ReportViewer, etc.) — just the skeleton.
- `AppTopBar` breadcrumb slot is empty.
- No user menu in top bar yet.
- `STRIPE_UPGRADE_LINK` env var not yet set in Vercel.
- `standalone_punchwalk` boolean column + all TS-side `punchwalk` references still use old name (deferred — separate renaming scope).

### Context Files Updated
- `SLATE360_PROJECT_MEMORY.md`: this handoff

### Next Steps (ordered)
1. **Enable JWT hook** in Supabase Dashboard → Auth → Hooks.
2. Build cleanup queue worker (cron or edge function).
3. Build type-specific deliverable viewers for the portal skeleton.
4. Add breadcrumb context + user menu to `AppTopBar`.
5. Build Tour Builder "Join/Leave" seat UI.
6. Set `STRIPE_UPGRADE_LINK` in Vercel env.
7. Rename `standalone_punchwalk` column + TS-side `punchwalk` references to `site_walk` (full rename pass).
