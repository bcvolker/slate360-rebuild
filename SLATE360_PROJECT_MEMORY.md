# Slate360 — Project Memory

Last Updated: 2026-03-31
Repo: bcvolker/slate360-rebuild
Branch: main
Live: https://www.slate360.ai

This file is the default new-chat attachment. Keep it short. Read this first, then only pull the docs required for the task.

## Start Here

Recommended read order:
1. This file
2. `slate360-context/NEW_CHAT_HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md`
3. Only task-relevant docs

Do not read all context files by default.

## Project Snapshot

Slate360 is a Next.js 15 + React 19 + TypeScript SaaS platform with:
- Supabase for auth and primary data
- AWS S3 for file storage
- Stripe for billing
- Vercel for hosting and cron
- Market Robot as an internal route at `/market`

Primary live modules:
- `/dashboard`
- `/project-hub`
- `/slatedrop`
- `/market`

Tier note:
- subscription tiers are `trial < creator < model < business < enterprise`
- subscription gates use `getEntitlements()`
- trial tier unlocks ALL tabs with tight limits (500 credits, 5GB, 1 seat) + TrialBanner
- `/ceo`, `/market`, and `/athlete360` are internal access routes, not subscription features

## Critical Rules

1. No production `.ts` / `.tsx` / `.js` file over 300 lines.
2. No `any`.
3. Use shared auth wrappers and response helpers.
4. Types come from `lib/types/`.
5. Server components first.
6. Internal routes (`/ceo`, `/market`, `/athlete360`) do not use entitlements.
7. Subscription gates must use `getEntitlements()`.
8. New folder writes use `project_folders`.
9. No mock data in production UI.
10. Update context docs after code changes.

## Backend Quick Access

### Supabase
- URL: `https://hadnfcenpcfaeclczsmm.supabase.co`
- Dashboard: `https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/hadnfcenpcfaeclczsmm`
- Local secrets: `.env.local`
- Clients:

```typescript
import { createClient } from "@/lib/supabase/client";
import { createServerSupabaseClient } from "@/lib/supabase/server";
import { createAdminClient } from "@/lib/supabase/admin";
```

### AWS S3
- Bucket: `slate360-storage`
- Region: `us-east-2`
- Client: `lib/s3.ts`

### Vercel
- Auto-deploy from `main`
- Cron source: `vercel.json`
- Stripe secrets live in Vercel envs
- CLI access via `VERCEL_TOKEN` Codespace secret (linked to `slate360/slate360-rebuild`)
- Env var dashboard: `https://vercel.com/slate360/slate360-rebuild/settings/environment-variables`

### Git
- Default branch: `main`
- Standard flow: local edit -> typecheck / verify -> commit -> push
- Do not assume unrelated dirty changes are yours

## Core Commands

```bash
npm run dev
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm run diag:market-runtime
npm run verify:release
bash scripts/check-file-size.sh
```

During build/release work, also run the relevant guards before pushing shared or backend changes.

## Market Robot Focus

Route and gate:
- Route: `/market`
- Gate: `resolveServerOrgContext().canAccessMarket`

Current reality (2026-03-20):
- Tab routing works (6 tabs), 0 TS errors, deploys cleanly
- **Data wiring is completely disconnected** — orchestrator passes dummy data to all tabs
- Backend is production-grade: 8 real hooks, 17 API routes, 25 lib utilities, typed contracts
- V2 rebuild approved — wire orchestrator to hooks first, then rebuild tabs one at a time
- See `MARKET_ROBOT_STATUS_HANDOFF.md` for full critique, V2 plan, and prompt templates

Most important Market files:
- `app/market/page.tsx` — route entry (server component, auth gate)
- `components/dashboard/market/MarketClient.tsx` — orchestrator (needs rewiring)
- `components/dashboard/market/` — all tab components
- `lib/hooks/useMarket*` — 8 working hooks (the entire data layer)
- `lib/market/` — 25 utility files (contracts, mappers, bot engine, scheduler)
- `app/api/market/` — 17 API routes

Files to delete:
- `components/dashboard/MarketClient.tsx` (old, orphaned, 75 lines)
- `components/dashboard/market/MarketRobotWorkspace.tsx` (unused, 84 lines)
- `MARKET_ROBOT_STATUS_HANDOFF.md.bak` (backup of old handoff)

## Archive And Token Policy

Do not pull large history docs unless the task needs them. Default reference-only files:
- `slate360-context/dashboard-tabs/market-robot/CURRENT_STATE_HANDOFF.md`
- `slate360-context/dashboard-tabs/market-robot/ONGOING_BUILD_TRACKER.md`
- `slate360-context/FUTURE_FEATURES.md`
- `slate360-context/APP_ECOSYSTEM_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`
- `slate360-context/SUPABASE_EMAIL_TEMPLATES.md`

Use those files only for deep history, roadmap, or recovery work.

## Latest Session Handoff

<!-- Each chat MUST overwrite this section at end of conversation. Next chat reads this first. -->

### Session Handoff — 2026-04-01 (DJI 360 Live Streaming Feasibility Review)

### What Changed
- `SLATE360_PROJECT_MEMORY.md`: replaced the prior handoff with a feasibility review for live 360 drone streaming into Slate360.

### What's Broken / Partially Done
- Slate360 has no native live 360 video ingest path yet; current media support is file upload, sharing, and planned 360 tour playback rather than low-latency streaming.
- Multi-user independent look-around requires a true live equirectangular 360 feed from the drone/camera stack; if the DJI setup only exposes a pilot-view preview, Slate360 can only show that flat feed live and the full 360 as delayed upload/segment playback.
- The 360 Tours area is scaffolded only and would need backend tables, APIs, and a real viewer/editor before it can become the permanent construction-site 360 playback surface.

### Context Files Updated
- `SLATE360_PROJECT_MEMORY.md`: documented the live 360 streaming assessment and implementation gap summary.

### Next Steps (ordered)
1. Confirm the exact camera/output path for the DJI setup: true stitched live 360 output vs local-only 360 recording.
2. Decide whether the first release should be low-latency live viewing, near-real-time segmented playback, or both.
3. Build a minimal public/private 360 video viewer route on top of existing SlateDrop/share infrastructure.
4. Add a streaming ingest service layer and project-scoped session model before integrating the feature into Project Hub or Tours.
