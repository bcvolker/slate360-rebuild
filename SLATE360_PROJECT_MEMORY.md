"# Slate360 — Project Memory

Last Updated: 2026-04-08
Repo: bcvolker/slate360-rebuild
Branch: main
Live: https://www.slate360.ai

This file is the default new-chat attachment. Keep it short. Read this first, then only pull the docs required for the task.

## AI Agent Access

**AI Agents (Copilot, Claude, etc.) have read/write/run/push access to:**
- **Git**: commit, branch, merge, and push to `bcvolker/slate360-rebuild` on GitHub
- **Vercel**: deploy + env var management via `VERCEL_TOKEN` Codespace secret
- **AWS S3**: bucket `slate360-storage` (us-east-2) via stored credentials
- **Stripe**: webhook and billing management via Vercel env secrets
- **Supabase CLI**: migrations, RPC functions, schema changes to project `hadnfcenpcfaeclczsmm`

This access is intentional. Agents are expected to push commits, run migrations, and deploy — not just suggest changes.

## Start Here

Recommended read order:
1. This file
2. `slate360-context/NEW_CHAT_HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md`
3. Only task-relevant docs

Do not read all context files by default.

## Project Snapshot

Slate360 is a Next.js 15 + React 19 + TypeScript SaaS platform with:
- Supabase for auth and primary data
- AWS S3 for file storage
- Stripe for billing
- Vercel for hosting and cron
- Market Robot as an internal route at `/market`

Primary live modules:
- `/dashboard`
- `/project-hub`
- `/slatedrop`
- `/market`

Tier note:
- subscription tiers are `trial < creator < model < business < enterprise`
- subscription gates use `getEntitlements()`
- trial tier unlocks ALL tabs with tight limits (500 credits, 5GB, 1 seat) + TrialBanner
- `/ceo`, `/market`, and `/athlete360` are internal access routes, not subscription features

## Critical Rules

1. No production `.ts` / `.tsx` / `.js` file over 300 lines.
2. No `any`.
3. Use shared auth wrappers and response helpers.
4. Types come from `lib/types/`.
5. Server components first.
6. Internal routes (`/ceo`, `/market`, `/athlete360`) do not use entitlements.
7. Subscription gates must use `getEntitlements()`.
8. New folder writes use `project_folders`.
9. No mock data in production UI.
10. Update context docs after code changes.

## Backend Quick Access

### Supabase
- URL: `https://hadnfcenpcfaeclczsmm.supabase.co`
- Dashboard: `https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/hadnfcenpcfaeclczsmm`
- Local secrets: `.env.local`
- Clients:

```typescript
import { createClient } from "@/lib/supabase/client";
import { createServerSupabaseClient } from "@/lib/supabase/server";
import { createAdminClient } from "@/lib/supabase/admin";
```

### AWS S3
- Bucket: `slate360-storage`
- Region: `us-east-2`
- Client: `lib/s3.ts`

### Vercel
- Auto-deploy from `main`
- Cron source: `vercel.json`
- Stripe secrets live in Vercel envs
- CLI access via `VERCEL_TOKEN` Codespace secret (linked to `slate360/slate360-rebuild`)
- Env var dashboard: `https://vercel.com/slate360/slate360-rebuild/settings/environment-variables`

### Git
- Default branch: `main`
- Standard flow: local edit -> typecheck / verify -> commit -> push
- Do not assume unrelated dirty changes are yours

## Core Commands

```bash
npm run dev
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm run diag:market-runtime
npm run verify:release
bash scripts/check-file-size.sh
```

During build/release work, also run the relevant guards before pushing shared or backend changes.

## Market Robot Focus

Route and gate:
- Route: `/market`
- Gate: `resolveServerOrgContext().canAccessMarket`

Current reality (2026-03-20):
- Tab routing works (6 tabs), 0 TS errors, deploys cleanly
- **Data wiring is completely disconnected** — orchestrator passes dummy data to all tabs
- Backend is production-grade: 8 real hooks, 17 API routes, 25 lib utilities, typed contracts
- V2 rebuild approved — wire orchestrator to hooks first, then rebuild tabs one at a time
- See `MARKET_ROBOT_STATUS_HANDOFF.md` for full critique, V2 plan, and prompt templates

Most important Market files:
- `app/market/page.tsx` — route entry (server component, auth gate)
- `components/dashboard/market/MarketClient.tsx` — orchestrator (needs rewiring)
- `components/dashboard/market/` — all tab components
- `lib/hooks/useMarket*` — 8 working hooks (the entire data layer)
- `lib/market/` — 25 utility files (contracts, mappers, bot engine, scheduler)
- `app/api/market/` — 17 API routes

Files to delete:
- `components/dashboard/MarketClient.tsx` (old, orphaned, 75 lines)
- `components/dashboard/market/MarketRobotWorkspace.tsx` (unused, 84 lines)
- `MARKET_ROBOT_STATUS_HANDOFF.md.bak` (backup of old handoff)

## Archive And Token Policy

Do not pull large history docs unless the task needs them. Default reference-only files:
- `slate360-context/dashboard-tabs/market-robot/CURRENT_STATE_HANDOFF.md`
- `slate360-context/dashboard-tabs/market-robot/ONGOING_BUILD_TRACKER.md`
- `slate360-context/FUTURE_FEATURES.md`
- `slate360-context/APP_ECOSYSTEM_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`
- `slate360-context/SUPABASE_EMAIL_TEMPLATES.md`

Use those files only for deep history, roadmap, or recovery work.

## Latest Session Handoff

<!-- Each chat MUST overwrite this section at end of conversation. Next chat reads this first. -->

### Session Handoff — 2026-04-09 (Production Merge: Marketing Homepage + Auth Dark Glass + Ghost Redirects)

### What Changed

**Merged `feature/marketing-homepage` → `main` (commit `3c1b004`)**

This merge includes everything from `feature/dashboard-integration` plus:

**1. v0 Marketing Homepage (commit `27e6267`)**
- Full v0-generated marketing homepage split into sub-300-line components under `components/home/`
- Components: HeroSection, AppShowcaseSection, AppDemos, TestimonialsSection, PricingSection, CTASection, LandingHeader, LandingFooter, LoginModal, LandingPage, landing-data.ts
- Deleted obsolete: HomeModals, MoreToolsSection, PlatformSection, ViewerHelpers, home-data.ts
- `app/page.tsx`: renders `<LandingPage />` for guests, redirects auth to `/dashboard`
- Favicon: deleted `app/favicon.ico` (stale navy blue); `app/icon.svg` is sole favicon

**2. Auth UI Dark Glass Overhaul (commit `4ccd1c2`)**
- `app/login/page.tsx` (165 lines): full Dark Glass + Industrial Gold restyling
- `app/signup/page.tsx` (196 lines, down from 306): Dark Glass + extracted confirmation
- `app/forgot-password/page.tsx` (101 lines): full Dark Glass restyling
- `components/auth/SignupConfirmation.tsx` (116 lines, NEW): extracted from signup for 300-line compliance
- All: bg-zinc-950, glass cards (bg-zinc-900/60 backdrop-blur), gold #D4AF37 CTAs, white Reversed Lockup logo

**3. /apps Ghost Redirect Elimination (commit `4ccd1c2`)**
- `middleware.ts`: removed `/apps` from auth-required list, all redirects → `/dashboard`
- `app/(apps)/site-walk/page.tsx`: redirect → `/dashboard`
- `app/(apps)/tour-builder/page.tsx`: redirect → `/dashboard`
- `components/apps/AppSidebar.tsx`: settings href → `/dashboard`
- Zero remaining `/apps` route references in codebase

**4. Prior work included in merge (from `feature/dashboard-integration`)**
- Dashboard moved to `app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx` (route group)
- Mobile Sheet nav (`components/shared/MobileNavSheet.tsx`)
- Single-app entitlement auto-navigate
- `_v0_drop/` air-gap staging directory

**Build:** ✅ 82 pages, 0 TS errors. Pushed to `origin/main` → Vercel auto-deploys to slate360.ai.

### What's Broken / Partially Done
- **CRITICAL**: `market_scheduler_lock` table still has no RLS
- **CRITICAL**: Portal view_count race condition (atomic SQL not deployed yet)
- `fix/slatedrop-external-uploads` — still needs merge to main (security patch)
- Duplicate `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in `.env` line 75 (missing `whsec_` prefix)
- Block Editor is UI-only (no backend persistence)
- Rate limiting only on ~5 of 40+ API routes
- Sentry + PostHog + `STRIPE_UPGRADE_LINK` env vars not set in Vercel

### Context Files Updated
- `SLATE360_PROJECT_MEMORY.md`: this handoff

### Next Steps (ordered)
1. Merge `fix/slatedrop-external-uploads` → main (security patch, already reviewed)
2. **CRITICAL** — Add RLS to `market_scheduler_lock` (deny all except service_role)
3. **CRITICAL** — Deploy atomic `claim_deliverable_view()` RPC to fix portal view_count race
4. Set Sentry + PostHog + `STRIPE_UPGRADE_LINK` env vars in Vercel
5. Enable JWT hook in Supabase Dashboard → Auth → Hooks
6. Add Block Editor backend persistence
8. Expand rate limiting to remaining API routes
