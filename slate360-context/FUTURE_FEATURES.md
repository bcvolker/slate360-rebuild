# Slate360 — Build Roadmap & Future Features

**Last Updated:** 2026-03-11 (App ecosystem execution plan added; revenue-first launch order documented; earlier Mar 4 Session 6 updates preserved)  
**Priority Order:** Foundation → Project Hub → Design Studio → App Ecosystem → Remaining Modules → Advanced Features → Native Apps  
**Status Key:** ✅ Done · 🟢 In Progress · 🟡 Planned · 🔴 Not Started

---

## Refactor Continuity Note (Mar 4, 2026)

- Active refactor closure window is tracked in `REFACTOR_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` with a detailed 8–19 prompt execution map.
- Current expectation: completing Slice C (Project Hub), the next Dashboard decomposition tranche, and BUG-018 (`LocationMap.tsx` DrawingManager removal) should complete the core refactor scope.
- Mar 4 2026 (Session 5): BUG-018 completed in `LocationMap.tsx` (all drawing tools now native; DrawingManager/drawing library removed).
- Mar 4 2026 (Session 6): Critical entitlement misconfiguration fixed — `trial` tier was incorrectly granting access to ALL modules. Now correctly locked to `canAccessHub + canViewSlateDropWidget` only. Phase 0G (Quick Wins) and Phase 0H (Code Health Pass) added below.
- Work remaining after the refactor window: Phase 0G/0H quick wins, then roadmap delivery. No more core refactor blockers.

### Accurate File Sizes (March 4, 2026)

| File | Lines | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `components/dashboard/MarketClient.tsx` | 3,006 | ❌ Not decomposed — highest priority |

## Architecture Readiness Analysis

### Tab Ecosystem — Current State (All 12 Tabs)

| Tab | Route | Scaffolding | Content | Shell |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Dashboard Home | `/(dashboard)` | ✅ `DashboardClient.tsx` | ✅ Built (SPA mega-component) | ❌ Own header (has QuickNav) |
| Project Hub | `/project-hub` | ✅ Standalone layout | ✅ Built (3-tier structure) | ❌ Own header (has QuickNav) |
| SlateDrop | `/slatedrop` | ✅ Standalone page | ✅ Built | ❌ Own header (no QuickNav) |
| Design Studio | `/(dashboard)/design-studio` | ✅ `DashboardTabShell` | 🟡 Coming Soon scaffold | ✅ Shared (isCeo ✅) |
| Content Studio | `/(dashboard)/content-studio` | ✅ `DashboardTabShell` | 🟡 Coming Soon scaffold | ✅ Shared (isCeo ✅) |
| 360 Tours | `/(dashboard)/tours` | ✅ `DashboardTabShell` | 🟡 Coming Soon scaffold | ✅ Shared (isCeo ✅) |
| Geospatial | `/(dashboard)/geospatial` | ✅ `DashboardTabShell` | 🟡 Coming Soon scaffold | ✅ Shared (isCeo ✅) |
| Virtual Studio | `/(dashboard)/virtual-studio` | ✅ `DashboardTabShell` | 🟡 Coming Soon scaffold | ✅ Shared (isCeo ✅) |
| Analytics | `/(dashboard)/analytics` | ✅ `DashboardTabShell` | ✅ Report Builder v1 (UI) | ✅ Shared (isCeo ✅) |
| CEO | `/(dashboard)/ceo` | ✅ `DashboardTabShell` | 🟡 Stub | ✅ Shared (isCeo ✅) |
| Market Robot | `/market` | ✅ `MarketClient.tsx` | ✅ Built | ❌ Own header (no QuickNav) |
| Athlete360 | `/athlete360` | ✅ Standalone page | 🟡 Stub | ❌ Own header (no QuickNav) |
| My Account | `/(dashboard)/my-account` | ✅ `DashboardTabShell` | 🟡 Coming Soon scaffold | ✅ Shared (isCeo ✅) |

**Decisions made:**
- `DashboardTabShell` (shared component) standardizes: light theme, `max-w-7xl` content, `z-50` header, back-to-dashboard link in top-left, QuickNav dropdown in top-right.
- All new tabs USE `DashboardTabShell` automatically with `isCeo` prop.
- Analytics converted from dark theme to light DashboardTabShell (2026-03-04).
- CEO uses DashboardTabShell (light theme, 2026-03-03).
- Legacy tabs (Dashboard, Project Hub, SlateDrop, Market) retain own headers until Phase 0B decomposition.
- `QuickNav` (shared dropdown) includes all 13 navigation targets, tier-gated via `getEntitlements()`.
- CEO account (`slate360ceo@gmail.com`) gets enterprise entitlements via `getEntitlements(tier, { isSlateCeo })` override.
- Internal-tab access (`/ceo`, `/market`, `/athlete360`) is gated via `hasInternalAccess = isSlateCeo || isSlateStaff`.

### Architecture Readiness for Future Phases

| Phase | Architecture Ready? | Gaps |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 0 (Foundation) | ✅ Ready | Just execution work — no infra blockers |
| Phase 1 (Project Hub) | ✅ Ready | Tool pages exist, need enhancement. Observations feature added. |
| Phase 2 (Design Studio) | ✅ Shell ready | `DashboardTabShell` in place. Needs Zustand store + viewer stack. Route exists. |
| Phase 3 (App Ecosystem) | 🟡 Partially ready | Standalone routes exist for 6 tabs. Missing: `manifest.webmanifest`, service worker, `org_feature_flags` table, per-app Stripe products. |
| Phase 4 (Remaining Modules) | ✅ Shell ready | All 5 module routes scaffolded with `DashboardTabShell`. Each just needs content implementation. |
| Phase 5 (Advanced) | 🟡 Partially ready | GPU pipeline, Redis, realtime — all require new infrastructure. No code blockers. |
| Phase 6 (Native Apps) | 🔴 Not ready | Needs PWA foundation (Phase 3A) first. No Capacitor installed. |

### Key Architectural Strengths

1. **Modular routing:** Each tab is a standalone Next.js page — no coupling between modules
2. **Shared auth layer:** `withAuth()` / `withProjectAuth()` works for any new API route
3. **Entitlements system:** `getEntitlements(tier, { isSlateCeo? })` cleanly gates module access. CEO account gets enterprise entitlements regardless of DB tier. **CEO/internal platform tabs (`/ceo`, `/market`, `/athlete360`) are gated by `hasInternalAccess` directly — never via entitlements.**
4. **SlateDrop as common storage:** All modules can save artifacts via `saveProjectArtifact()`
5. **Shared UI patterns:** `ViewCustomizer`, `ChangeHistory`, `DashboardTabShell` are reusable
6. **QuickNav centralized:** Single navigation dropdown shared across all tab pages, tier-gated
7. **Consistent navigation:** DashboardTabShell provides uniform header (logo + back-link on left, QuickNav + user menu on right) with `isCeo` prop flowing from server through shells

### Key Risks / Debt to Address Before Scale

1. **DashboardClient.tsx (~2,953 lines)** — Must decompose before adding more dashboard logic
2. **Shared `(dashboard)/layout.tsx` only baseline-complete** — route-group layout now exists, but legacy pages still diverge on header/nav composition.
3. **Activity log baseline now active in core tools** — `project_activity_log` migration + helper exist, with create/update/delete logging wired for RFIs, Submittals, Schedule, Budget, Punch List, Daily Logs, Observations, Records, and Management Contracts. Remaining project mutations should be phased in.
4. **PWA/mobile infra now partially started** — manifest + mobile viewport/standalone metadata are in place; service worker/runtime caching still missing.
5. **Web3 global load issue mitigated** — wagmi/react-query providers are now Market-scoped; keep future Web3 imports route-scoped.
6. **Org provisioning fallback now implemented** — callback + dashboard fallback bootstrap added; webhook path still recommended for deterministic first-write provisioning.
7. **`slate360_staff` table may be missing in some environments** — code has graceful fallback. If table is missing, only `slate360ceo@gmail.com` has internal-tab access.

## How This Document Works

Every feature ever discussed is preserved here, organized into **7 build phases** in safe dependency order. Each phase lists what to build, what it depends on, and what infrastructure it needs. No feature or idea has been removed — items from the original planning docs, competitor analysis (Procore), Design Studio vision docs, app ecosystem specs, SlateDrop "wow features," and GPU processing specs are all included, consolidated, and de-duplicated.

---

## Phase 0 — Foundation & Tech Debt (DO FIRST)

These items unblock everything else. No new features until these are stable.

### 0A. Shared UI Component Library

| Component | Purpose | Needed By |
|---|---|---|
| `Modal` / `ConfirmDialog` | Consistent modals across all modules | All |
| `DataTable` | Sortable/filterable/paginated table | Project Hub tools, Analytics |
| `FormField` / `FormSection` | Consistent form layout | All creation flows |
| `EmptyState` | No-data placeholder | All modules |
| `StatusPill` | Colored status badges | Project Hub, SlateDrop |
| `FileUploadZone` | Drag-and-drop upload area | SlateDrop, Design Studio, 360 Tour |
| `SlideOverPanel` | Right-side drawer (ChangeHistory pattern) | All detail views |
| `CommandPalette` | Global keyboard search (Cmd+K) | Platform-wide |
| `TierGate` | UI wrapper that hides/shows based on entitlements | All gated features |

**What to do:** Create `components/ui/` files, each < 300 lines. Extract from existing inline implementations in DashboardClient, SlateDropClient, and tool pages.

### 0B. File Decomposition (300-Line Rule)

17 files exceed the limit. Decompose in this order (highest impact first):

| Priority | File | Lines | Extract Into |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `DashboardClient.tsx` | 2,915 | ~10 files (shell, header, stats, cards, activity, widgets) |
| 2 | `SlateDropClient.tsx` | 2,030 | ~7 files (sidebar, grid, upload, context menu, preview, breadcrumb) |
| 3 | `MarketClient.tsx` | 3,006 | ~8 files (grid, card, form, filters, bot, detail) |
| 4 | `LocationMap.tsx` | 1,568 | ~5 files (container, controls, search, directions, drawing) |
| 5 | `management/page.tsx` | 934 | Extract contract/report/stakeholder components |
| 6 | All 9 tool pages | 324–593 | Extract table + form per page |

**What to do:** Follow safe refactor sequence from GUARDRAILS.md §4. One file at a time. No feature changes during decomposition.

### 0C. Activity / Audit Log Table

| Table | Columns |
|---|---|
| `project_activity_log` | `id`, `project_id`, `org_id`, `actor_user_id`, `entity_type` (rfi, submittal, etc.), `entity_id`, `action` (create, update, delete, comment, status_change), `field_name`, `old_value`, `new_value`, `metadata` (JSONB), `created_at` |

**What to do:** Create Supabase migration. Add RLS policy (org-scoped read, authenticated insert). Update `ChangeHistory` component to read from this table instead of `buildBaseHistory()`. Add `logActivity()` helper in `lib/server/audit.ts`. Wire into all Project Hub API routes.

### 0D. `file_folders` → `project_folders` Migration Phase 2

| Route / Service | Status |
|---|---|
| Design Studio file routes | 🔴 Migrate |
| `app/api/slatedrop/zip/route.ts` | 🔴 Migrate |
| Cross-tab upload service | 🔴 Migrate |
| Audit trail service | 🔴 Migrate |

**What to do:** Find all `file_folders` references, swap to `project_folders`, test, then Phase 3 = data sync + drop old table.

### 0E. Dependency Cleanup

| Task | Action |
|---|---|
| Recharts + Chart.js both present | Remove Chart.js, standardize on Recharts |
| 7 Web3 packages always loaded | Lazy-load via `next/dynamic` only on `/market` pages |
| PDF packages | Lazy-load only on report-generation pages |

### 0F. Cross-Tab Customization System (Required)

All tabs must implement a consistent customization layer per `slate360-context/dashboard-tabs/CUSTOMIZATION_SYSTEM.md`.

| Requirement | Description |
|---|---|
| Movable regions | Drag-reorder cards, tool groups, and workspace sections |
| Expandable/collapsible panels | Library, inspector, timeline/log panels |
| Resizable panel splits | User-controlled panel widths/heights with bounds |
| Mode presets | `simple`, `standard`, `advanced`, `custom` |
| Persistence | Per-user, per-tab saved preferences with versioning |

**What to do:** Implement shared preference shape/utilities, then apply to each tab shell and module workspace before advanced feature build-out.

## Phase 0H — Code Health Pass (Technical Debt Reduction)

These items directly address anti-patterns identified in the March 4 2026 architecture audit. Each restores reliability and makes future AI-session edits safer and more accurate.

### H1 — Create Shared Type Files (Missing Infrastructure)

| File to Create | Types to Move | Current Duplication |
|---|---|---|
| `lib/types/dashboard.ts` | `DashboardProject`, `DashboardJob`, `DashboardWidgetsPayload`, `LiveWeatherState`, `CalEvent`, `Contact` | Defined in both `DashboardClient.tsx` AND `useDashboardRuntimeData.ts` |
| `lib/types/project-hub.ts` | `Stakeholder`, `Contract`, `ProjectRfi`, `ProjectSubmittal`, `DailyLog`, `PunchItem` | Each defined inline in its own tool page — forces duplication in any shared usage |
| `lib/types/slatedrop.ts` | `UnifiedFile`, `SlateFolderNode`, `ShareToken` | Scattered across hooks and components |

**What to do:** Create each file, export types, update all imports. Zero behavior change.

### H2 — Remove Demo/Mock Data from Production Components

**Violation of Rule 9 (No mock data in production UI).**

| Location | What | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `DashboardClient.tsx` lines 244–340 | 8 demo data arrays: `demoProjects`, `demoEvents`, `demoContacts`, `demoJobs`, `demoFinancial`, `demoWeather`, `demoContinueWorking`, `demoSeatMembers` | Extract to `lib/dashboard/demo-data.ts` OR replace with proper empty states |

### H3 — Extract Inline Sub-Components

| Inline Component | File | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `TabWireframe` function (~50 lines) | `DashboardClient.tsx` | Move to `components/dashboard/TabWireframe.tsx` |
| `renderWidget` closure (~200 lines) | `DashboardClient.tsx` lines 1226–1430 | Extract to `components/dashboard/DashboardWidgetRenderer.tsx` |

**Expected DashboardClient.tsx result after H2 + H3:** ~1,600 lines (down from 2,043). Further decomposition continues in Phase 0B.

### H4 — Extract Pure Utility Functions

| Function | File | Target |
|---|---|---|
| `getCalendarDays()` | `DashboardClient.tsx` ~line 353 | `lib/utils/calendar.ts` |
| `statusColor()`, `statusIcon()`, `projectTypeEmoji()` | `DashboardClient.tsx` ~lines 370–407 | `lib/utils/project-status.ts` |
| `densityClass()` | Various tool pages | `lib/utils/view-density.ts` |

### H5 — Add Missing Error Boundary

A runtime crash inside any tab component currently unmounts the entire dashboard.

**What to do:** Create `app/(dashboard)/error.tsx` (~15 lines) — Next.js App Router convention catches route-level errors and renders a graceful fallback without unmounting the parent shell.

```typescript
// app/(dashboard)/error.tsx
"use client";
export default function DashboardError({ error, reset }: { error: Error; reset: () => void }) {
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center h-64 gap-4">
      <p className="text-sm text-destructive">Something went wrong in this tab.</p>
      <button onClick={reset} className="text-sm text-blue-600 underline">Try again</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### H6 — Replace `confirm()` Dialogs

`app/(dashboard)/project-hub/[projectId]/management/page.tsx` lines ~189 and ~228 use browser-native `confirm()` — a blocking dialog inconsistent with the 2-step deletion pattern. Replace with the existing `ConfirmDialog` / toast + inline confirmation pattern.

### H7 — Create `useProjectCrudBase` Hook Template

All 8 tool pages independently reimplement the same ~80-line fetch/loading/error/form-state scaffolding. A shared `useProjectCrudBase<T>` hook would eliminate ~640 lines of duplicated code across the project tools and make adding new tools trivial.

```typescript
// lib/hooks/useProjectCrudBase.ts
export function useProjectCrudBase<T>(endpoint: string, projectId: string) {
  // fetch, loading, error, create, update, delete, form state
  // returns: { items, loading, error, formOpen, openForm, submitForm, deleteItem }
}
```

### H8 — Create `ProjectToolLayout` Component

Every Tier 3 tool page renders its own breadcrumb, back-nav, page header, view customizer, and export button — ~40 lines of identical chrome per page (320 lines total).

```typescript
// components/project-hub/ProjectToolLayout.tsx
// Props: title, projectId, actions?, children
// Renders: breadcrumb, back link, title, view customizer slot, action slot, children
```

### H9 — Design Token Abstraction

Hardcoded hex values `#FF4D00` (Slate orange) and `#1E3A8A` (Slate blue) appear across hundreds of instances. No CSS variables or Tailwind custom tokens defined.

**What to do:** Add to `app/globals.css`:
```css
:root {
  --slate-orange: #FF4D00;
  --slate-blue: #1E3A8A;
  --slate-orange-hover: #E04400;
}
```
Then add to `tailwind.config.ts` colors. Long-term: required for white-label enterprise tier.

---

## Phase 0I — UI Consistency Sprint

UI improvements identified from cross-section review. Safe to implement incrementally without breaking existing functionality.

| Area | Recommendation | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| Top Bar Shell | Unify Dashboard + Project Hub headers — same height, logo position, nav pattern, user menu | High |
| Button Hierarchy | Standardize: orange = primary action, blue-outline = secondary, ghost = tertiary. Currently mixed across modules | High |
| Card Primitive | Create a shared `<Card>` with consistent padding (p-4), radius (rounded-xl), and shadow (shadow-sm) — replace ad-hoc implementations in widgets and Project Hub | Medium |
| Table Header/Action Bar | Consistent pattern: left-aligned filters, right-aligned Export/Add buttons, sticky on scroll | High |
| Empty States | Shared `<EmptyState icon title cta>` component — currently each tool page has its own one-off empty state | Medium |
| Location Widget Toolbar | Compact grouping: drawing tools in one segmented control, map type in another, clear/export at far right. Sticky "status" line below toolbar showing current tool + last saved | Medium |
| Module Identity Accents | Subtle left-border or badge on each module tab in the nav: Hub = blue, Design = purple, Content = pink, Tours = teal, Geo = green. No new themes required — Tailwind border colors | Low |
| Map Control Contrast | Map overlay controls (drawing palette, search bar, layer switcher) need stronger background contrast against satellite imagery | Low |
| Spacing + Corner Radius | Align 8px grid and `rounded-xl` (16px radius) consistently between Dashboard widgets and Project Hub cards | Medium |
| Status Pills | Standardize color coding across RFIs, Submittals, Punch List: `open=blue`, `in-review=yellow`, `approved/closed=green`, `overdue=red` | Medium |

---

## Phase 1 — Complete Project Hub (PRIORITY)

Project Hub is 80% built. These items finish it to production quality.

### 1A. Finish Tool Views

Each tool page needs: real CRUD (mostly done), proper empty states, export (CSV/PDF), ViewCustomizer wired to row styling, and ChangeHistory reading from `project_activity_log`.

| Tool | Remaining Work | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| RFIs | Wire `densityClass()` to row padding; export PDF; attachment preview | High |
| Submittals | Wire density; revision tracking; export PDF | High |
| Daily Logs | Photo upload field; weather auto-save server-side; CSV export to SlateDrop | High |
| Punch List | Photo attachment per item; PDF export with photos | High |
| Budget | Budget vs. actual chart (Recharts); CSV import; change order log | High |
| Schedule | Gantt dependencies (predecessor/successor); critical path highlighting; baseline comparison | High |
| Drawings | PDF markup / redline annotations (canvas overlay layer); revision set management | Medium |
| Photos | Bulk upload; photo timeline slider; AI tagging (future) | Medium |
| Management | Contract e-signature integration; insurance cert tracking; lien waiver management | Medium |

### 1B. Project Home (Tier 2) Overview Cards

| Widget | Data Source | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| Recent activity feed (last 10 changes) | `project_activity_log` | High |
| Open items summary (RFIs, punch, submittals) | Aggregate query | High |
| Budget health gauge | Budget table variance | Medium |
| Milestone countdown ticker | Schedule milestones | Medium |
| Live weather | Open-Meteo API (already in UI) | Low |

### 1C. Notification Center

| Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `notifications` table | Already exists in DB |
| In-app notification bell | Show unread count, dropdown list |
| Notification triggers | RFI response, submittal approval, overdue punch, budget alert |
| Email digests (Resend) | Daily/weekly project digest to stakeholders |

**What to do:** Build `NotificationBell` component. Add `POST /api/notifications/mark-read`. Add triggers in each API route that creates/updates records.

### 1D. External Stakeholder Portal

| Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/external/project/[token]` | Read-only project view (no account required) |
| External RFI response form | Client responds to RFI via token link |
| External submittal approval | Approve/reject with signature |

**What to do:** Create `slatedrop_shares`-style token system. Build minimal read-only project viewer. Wire to RFI/submittal email notifications.

### 1E. Project Hub — Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

These are valuable but not blocking MVP:

| Feature | Tool | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| RFI distribution list email blast | RFIs | Medium |
| RFI response SLA tracking with countdown | RFIs | Medium |
| Link RFIs to drawings (pin on PDF) | RFIs + Drawings | Medium |
| RFI → Change Order conversion | RFIs + Budget | Medium |
| AIA document workflow with e-signature | Submittals | Medium |
| Submittal log reconciliation vs spec sections | Submittals | Low |
| Revision tracking with side-by-side diff | Submittals | Low |
| Submittal package bundling (ZIP export) | Submittals | Low |
| Daily log photo upload (camera capture on mobile) | Daily Logs | Medium |
| Crew count analytics chart (trades vs. time) | Daily Logs | Low |
| QR code scan to open punch item on site | Punch List | Low |
| Contractor notification on punch assignment | Punch List | Medium |
| Drawing comparison (overlay two revisions) | Drawings | Medium |
| Issue log linked to drawing sheets | Drawings | Low |
| RFI / Punch item pin on drawing | Drawings | Medium |
| AI photo tagging (location, trade, progress %) | Photos | Low |
| 360° photo viewer (equirectangular pano) | Photos | Medium |
| Photo timeline slider (date-based progress) | Photos | Low |
| Before/after comparison slider | Photos | Low |
| Invoice matching against budget line items | Budget | Medium |
| Cash flow projection chart | Budget | Low |
| Integration with QuickBooks / Procore budget export | Budget | Low |
| Pay application auto-gen (AIA G702/G703) | Budget | Medium |
| Schedule import from MS Project / P6 | Schedule | Medium |
| Resource leveling | Schedule | Low |
| S-curve earned value chart | Schedule | Low |
| Subcontractor pre-qualification checklist | Management | Low |
| Project closeout checklist with document bundling | Management | Medium |
| Org-level contractor database (reuse across projects) | Management | Medium |

---

## Phase 2 — Design Studio (MVP Module)

Design Studio is the flagship creative module. It differentiates Slate360 from pure PM tools like Procore.

### 2A. Shell & Workspace

**Layout (always consistent):**
- **Top bar:** Module title, project selector, Simple/Advanced toggle, undo/redo, save, export, share
- **Left panel:** File browser (from SlateDrop), asset library, versions/timeline, upload dropzone
- **Center canvas:** Three.js / React Three Fiber viewport (3D) or PDF.js overlay (2D)
- **Right panel:** Properties, inspector, comments — changes based on mode + selection
- **Bottom bar:** Mode tabs: Upload · Design · Review · Print · Analyze · Animate

**What to do:**
1. Create `app/(dashboard)/design-studio/page.tsx` (server component, tier-gated)
2. Create `components/design-studio/DesignStudioShell.tsx` (client, layout frame)
3. Create Zustand store: `lib/hooks/useDesignStudioStore.ts` (project state, tool state, selection, pins, jobs)
4. Gate with `getEntitlements(tier).canAccessDesignStudio`

**User profile presets (control tool complexity):**

| Preset | Access Level |
|---|---|
| Starter | View + annotate + export |
| Pro | BIM layers, transforms, 2D underlays, basic print tools |

## Phase 3 — App Ecosystem Infrastructure

This makes Slate360 modules individually subscribable and installable.

**Canonical execution blueprint:** See `slate360-context/APP_ECOSYSTEM_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` for the revenue-first launch order, app-by-app build strategies, use cases, and the long-term deliverables/sharing/sync model. This section remains the roadmap summary; the execution-plan file is the working product playbook.

### 3A. PWA Foundation

**Currently missing — zero PWA infrastructure exists.** Marketing pages claim PWA but nothing is implemented.

| Task | What to Do |
|---|---|
| Create `app/manifest.ts` (`/manifest.webmanifest`) | App name, icons, `display: standalone`, `start_url`, theme/bg colors (`#1E3A8A` / `#FF4D00`) |
| Add manifest link to `app/layout.tsx` | `<link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.webmanifest">` + `themeColor` + `apple-touch-icon` |
| Install `next-pwa` or `@ducanh2912/next-pwa` | Configure in `next.config.ts` with runtime caching strategies |
| Create service worker config | Cache static assets, API responses for offline capability |
| Add install prompt component | "Add to Home Screen" banner for mobile/desktop |
| Generate app icons | 192×192, 512×512 PNG icons from Slate360 logo |

### 3B. Per-Module Standalone Routes

Each module should work as both a Slate360 dashboard tab AND a standalone entry:

| Module | Integrated Route | Standalone Route | Standalone Pricing |
|---|---|---|---|
| SlateDrop | `/(dashboard)` widget | `/slatedrop` (exists) | $39–$99/mo |
| 360 Tour Builder | `/(dashboard)/tour-builder` | `/tour-builder` | $25–$99/mo |
| Punch Walk | (integrated w/ Project Hub) | `/punch-walk` (PWA) | $15–$49/mo |
| Photo Log | (integrated w/ Project Hub) | `/photo-log` | $19/mo or per-report credits |
| Plans PDF Tool | (integrated w/ Design Studio) | `/plan-review` | $29–$99/mo |
| Walk-to-Quote | (new) | `/walk-to-quote` | $39–$149/mo |
| Field Uploader | (integrated w/ SlateDrop) | `/field-upload` (PWA) | Free w/ Business+; $9/mo standalone |
| Deliverable Packs | (integrated w/ SlateDrop) | N/A (feature, not standalone) | Included in tiers |

### 3C. Subscription Model for Standalone Apps

**Expand `lib/entitlements.ts`:**

```typescript
// Add to Entitlements interface:
canAccessStandaloneSlatedrop: boolean;
canAccessStandaloneTourBuilder: boolean;
canAccessStandalonePunchWalk: boolean;
canAccessStandalonePhotoLog: boolean;
canAccessStandalonePlanReview: boolean;
canAccessStandaloneWalkToQuote: boolean;
canAccessStandaloneFieldUploader: boolean;
```

**Key principle:** Users who subscribe to Slate360 (creator/model/business/enterprise) get the integrated versions. Users who subscribe to a standalone app get just that module + basic SlateDrop storage.

**What to do:**
1. Add `org_feature_flags` table: `org_id`, `feature_key`, `enabled`, `expires_at`
2. Update `getEntitlements()` to merge org-level flags with tier defaults
3. Add standalone Stripe products/prices per app
4. Create `/api/apps/subscribe` endpoint for standalone app checkout
5. Build app directory page at `/apps` (replaces current `/features/ecosystem-apps`)

### 3D. App Directory / Store Page

Replace the current marketing-only `/features/ecosystem-apps` page with a functional app directory:

| Section | Content |
|---|---|
| Hero | "Slate360 Apps — Download, Subscribe, Integrate" |
| App cards grid | Each standalone app with: icon, name, description, pricing, "Subscribe" / "Open" / "Install PWA" buttons |
| Integration badge | "Included with your {tier} plan" if user already has access |
| Install instructions | PWA install prompt for supported apps |

### 3D.1 Revenue-First Launch Order

Use this sequence unless real customer evidence forces a reorder:

1. `360 Tour Builder + Hosting`
2. `PunchWalk`
3. `SlateDrop Deliverables`
4. `Photo Log`
5. `Plan Review`
6. `Walk-to-Quote`
7. `Slate360 Capture`

**Reasoning:** the first three products have the clearest standalone value, shortest path to a sales demo, and strongest reuse of shared storage/sharing primitives.

### 3E. SlateDrop "Wow Features" (Foundation for App Ecosystem)

These SlateDrop upgrades serve both the integrated platform and standalone apps:

| Feature | What to Build | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| Request/upload-only links | `slatedrop_shares` table + token system + public upload page at `/public/slatedrop/[token]` | High |

| Deliverable packs | `slatedrop_packs` table + zip generation worker + manifest + share link | Medium |
| Deep links ("Open in tab") | `origin_tab`, `origin_route`, `origin_entity_id` columns on `unified_files` | Medium |
| Offline upload queue | IndexedDB (dexie) client queue + retry logic + "Uploads" tray UI | Medium |
| Storage quota warning UI | Show used/limit bar when approaching tier limit | Low |
| OCR on uploaded PDFs | Full-text search on PDF content | Low |

| Job queue | BullMQ + Redis/Upstash | 🔴 Not built |
| GPU worker (Docker) | COLMAP, OpenMVS, gsplat, PDAL | 🔴 Not built |
| Cost estimator | `POST /api/credits/estimate` | 🔴 Not built |
| Job tracking UI | Status polling + progress bar | 🔴 Not built |
| Auto-scaling | Spot instances (g4dn.xlarge → g5.8xlarge) | 🔴 Not built |

**Processing stack (Gaussian Splatting = PRIMARY deliverable):**

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| 3D Gaussian Splatting (Kerbl et al.) | Primary visual digital twin — MIT license, highest fidelity |
| gsplat / splatfacto | Faster training, better memory — NeRFStudio ecosystem |
| Instant-NGP NeRF (NVIDIA) | Optional enhancement for tight interiors / thin geometry |
| COLMAP | Camera pose estimation + sparse geometry (gold standard) |
| OpenMVG / OpenMVS | Fallback photogrammetry for engineering exports |

| Three.js + WebGPU | Custom GS renderer for browser delivery |
| gltf-pipeline | GLB optimization (Draco compression + LOD) |
| py3dtiles | Cesium 3D Tiles generation |

**Why Gaussian Splatting over mesh-first (RealityCapture):**
- Orders of magnitude faster than traditional photogrammetry
- Looks better than meshes for interiors, construction sites, as-builts
- Zero expensive licensing (open-source)
- Perfect for web + XR delivery
- Lower capture requirements, less fragile with incomplete coverage
- Market as "Live 3D Site Capture", not "photogrammetry"

**Tier gating for processing:**

| Tier | Access |
|---|---|
| MVP (all) | Gaussian Splatting only, photo+video input, web viewer, progress comparison |
| Pro (model+) | GS + NeRF, measurement overlays, time comparisons, section cuts |
| Enterprise | GS + NeRF + mesh, ODM integration, RTK/GCP, BIM alignment, legal export packages |

**Cost:** ~$105–$300/mo for GPU infrastructure (spot instances). Full spec: `GPU_WORKER_DEPLOYMENT.md`.

| Zapier / Make.com connector | Webhook-based | Low |
| API key management for customers | Self-service | Medium |
| Webhook events for third-party | Outbound events | Low |

**What to do:** Build `/(dashboard)/integrations` page (133 lines, exists as stub). Add `org_integrations` table. Start with one integration (DocuSign for contract signing) and build the pattern.

### 5E. Platform / Billing Enhancements

| Feature | Description | Priority |
|---|---|---|
| Self-service plan upgrade/downgrade | In My Account page | High |
| Seat management (add/remove org members) | Business/enterprise only | High |

---

## Phase 6 — Native Apps & App Store Distribution

### 6A. Capacitor Wrapper (PWA → Native)

| Step | What to Do |
|---|---|
| 1 | Install `@capacitor/core` + `@capacitor/cli` |
| 2 | Initialize: `npx cap init "Slate360" "ai.slate360.app"` |
| 3 | Add platforms: `npx cap add ios && npx cap add android` |
| 4 | Configure `capacitor.config.ts`: server URL, splash screen, status bar |
| 5 | Add native plugins: Camera, Filesystem, Geolocation, Push Notifications |
| 6 | Build: `next build && npx cap sync && npx cap open ios` |
| 7 | Test on simulators + physical devices |

**Why Capacitor over React Native:** Slate360 is already a Next.js web app. Capacitor wraps the existing web app in a native shell with access to native APIs. No rewrite needed. Same codebase ships to web + iOS + Android.

### 6B. Per-App Native Wrappers

| App | Bundle ID | App Store Name |
|---|---|---|
| Slate360 (main) | `ai.slate360.app` | Slate360 |
| SlateDrop | `ai.slate360.slatedrop` | SlateDrop by Slate360 |
| 360 Tour Builder | `ai.slate360.tour` | Slate360 Tours |
| Punch Walk | `ai.slate360.punch` | PunchWalk by Slate360 |
| Field Uploader | `ai.slate360.capture` | Slate360 Capture |

### 6C. App Store Submission Checklist

| Platform | Requirements |
|---|---|
| Apple App Store | Apple Developer account ($99/yr), screenshots, privacy policy, app review compliance |
| Google Play Store | Developer account ($25 one-time), content rating, privacy policy, target API level |
| Both | Push notification certs, in-app purchase integration (if selling standalone via stores) |

### 6D. Offline & Field Use

| Standalone app ecosystem | Monolithic platform |
| Target: small-mid jobs < $25M | Enterprise-focused |
| Combined PM + creative tools | PM only (no design/content) |

### Accessibility & UX Polish

| Feature | Priority |
|---|---|
| ARIA labels for all interactive elements | High |
| Keyboard navigation (panels, tools, search) | High |
| Focus management for modals/panels | Medium |
| High-contrast mode | Low |
