# Dashboard Features

## Purpose
The dashboard is the single launchpad for Slate360. It must feel simple on first use, but scale into a full operations console for business and enterprise teams. It is also the primary upgrade pathway from trial to paid tiers.

## Core Layout
- Shared dashboard shell (consistent top bar, navigation, and layout across all tabs).
- Widget-first design: every widget can expand into the full tool view.
- Portfolio-first layout for business and enterprise; content-first for creator and model tiers.

## Major Sections
### Portfolio Summary
- Project grid with status, open items, and recent activity.
- My Work queue for assigned RFIs, submittals, approvals, and tasks.
- Activity stream with cross-project updates.

### SlateDrop Entry Point
- Opens the unified SlateDrop explorer used everywhere else in the app.
- Dashboard view defaults to org-level folders with the Projects folder visible on tiers that include Project Hub.

### Location Tools
- Satellite + map view with markup and share.
- Supports preconstruction planning and stakeholder context.

### Financials + Credits
- Credit balance, consumption trends, and quick purchase flow.
- Business/Enterprise tiers see portfolio-level budget snapshots.

- New project wizard.
- Fast launch into Design Studio, Content Studio, 360 Tour Builder, and Geospatial.
- Contextual CTAs based on tier, role, and profile.
